Until a remote database, please use a local MSSQL. 

1- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
Install SQL Express, install local server, then install SSMS

2- In SSMS, create a new Database with name AlgoTrader
The connectionString is already in the code, so no need to change it
